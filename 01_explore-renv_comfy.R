# A little deja v√∫ from one of our first tasks! --------------------------------
# Take some notes as you go along.
library(fs)
library(tidyverse)


# In which libraries does R search for packages? -------------------------------
# your personal computing environment may return one or more locations
# .libPaths(), .Library


# Create a tibble of all installed packages ------------------------------------
# use installed.packages() to get all installed packages
# if you like working with data frame or tibble, make it so right away!
# remember to use View(), dplyr::glimpse(), or similar to inspect


# How many packages are installed? ---------------------------------------------


# Now lets do the same, after initiating renv! ---------------------------------
# Initiate renv, then go to the top of the document and got through it again. 
# What are the differences?



# If you have time to do more. -------------------------------------------------
# Try installing another package using renv::install.
# Can you tell how that is different from install.packages?
