# A little deja v√∫ from one of our first tasks! --------------------------------
# Take some notes as you go along.

# In which libraries does R search for packages? -------------------------------
# your personal computing environment may return one or more locations


# What is your default library? ------------------------------------------------


# Confirm the library supplied is, in fact, the default library. ---------------


# Create a tibble of all installed packages ------------------------------------


# How many packages are installed? ---------------------------------------------


# Now lets do the same, after initiating renv! ------------------------
# Initiate renv.
# After that finishes, go to the top of the document and got through it again. 
# What are the differences?

# If you have time to do more. -------------------------------------------------
# Try installing another package using renv::install.
# Can you tell how that is different from install.packages?
